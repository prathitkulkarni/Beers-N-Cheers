# Beers N Cheers

Beers N Cheers is a food ordering system developed using Object-Oriented Programming principles in C++. This project showcases the application of core OOP concepts to create a functional and maintainable system for managing food orders.

## About the Project

The Beers N Cheers project demonstrates how Object-Oriented Programming principles can be applied to develop a robust food ordering system. The system allows users to place and manage food orders, leveraging the core principles of OOP such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Features

- **Order Management:** Place, view, and manage food orders.
- **OOP Principles:** Utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to structure the codebase.
- **User Interface:** Simple command-line interface for interacting with the system.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
